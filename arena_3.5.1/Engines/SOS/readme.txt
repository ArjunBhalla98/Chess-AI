"SOS is an amateur program which was started in 1993 and has since
then competed in a number of tournaments. The newest version runs on
multiprocessor systems with a parallelized version of mtd(f) as its
minimax search algorithm. SOS used to be a realativley fast searcher
and relied on outsearching the opponent. This has changed now and more
knowledge and special cases have been implemented which slow it down.
Little effort is spent on the opening book. It plays a very broad range
of openings. However it learns to avoid unsuccessful lines and tries not
to repeat lost games. It uses publictly available endgame databases."

Since version 5.0 SOS supported MV (multi-variant) mode!
